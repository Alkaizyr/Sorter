>HEAP SUMMARY:

>in use at exit: 0 bytes in 0 blocks

>total heap usage: 'number' allocs, 'number' frees, 'bytes' bytes allocated

>All heap blocks were freed -- no leaks are possible

>ERROR SUMMARY: 0 errors from 0 contexts (suppressed: 0 from 0)

>ERROR SUMMARY: 0 errors from 0 contexts (suppressed: 0 from 0)

**AddressSanitizer** shows no problems.
